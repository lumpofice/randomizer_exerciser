This function is a teaching tool to be used in randomly assigning
students exercises to be worked on the board. For each exercise assigned
by the teacher, three students will be charged with presenting this assignment
in the following manner: The first set of students work the problem on the
board. The second set of students correct any mistakes made by the first
student. The third set of students explain to the class the solution to the
problem worked on the board. Some students may be shy about presenting (being
in the third set). For these students, I stipulate they be in the first set
of students every time. Further, some students may have been absent on days
the topic(s) was (were) discussed. Finally, some students may be absent on
the day presentations are expected. Prompting within this function has been
included to handle these situations.This function is a teaching tool to be used in randomly assigning
